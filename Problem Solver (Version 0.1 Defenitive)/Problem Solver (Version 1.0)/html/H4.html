<h1>GPU</h1>

<h2>1) What is the GPU?</h2>
<p>
    The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. It is an essential component in modern computers, primarily used for rendering images, videos, and animations with high efficiency and speed.

    Unlike the CPU (Central Processing Unit), which handles general-purpose computing tasks, the GPU is optimized for parallel processing of large blocks of data needed for visual computing tasks. GPUs are crucial for graphics-intensive applications such as gaming, video editing, CAD (Computer-Aided Design), and scientific simulations.

    Physically, a GPU is typically a single-chip processor mounted on a graphics card or integrated directly into a computer's motherboard. It consists of thousands of smaller processing cores designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, making it capable of performing complex calculations required for real-time rendering and image processing.

    Key features of a GPU include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shader Cores: Specialized processing units for handling vertex and pixel shaders, responsible for rendering 3D objects and scenes.</li>
    <li>Texture Mapping Units (TMUs): Units dedicated to applying textures to rendered objects, enhancing visual realism and detail.</li>
    <li>Rasterization: The process of converting 3D models into 2D images using a grid of pixels, essential for displaying graphics on a screen.</li>
    <li>Memory Interface: High-speed memory (VRAM) dedicated to storing and accessing graphics data quickly, reducing latency and improving performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In summary, the GPU plays a vital role in modern computing by accelerating tasks related to image rendering and visual processing, thereby enhancing the performance and user experience in applications demanding high-quality graphics and multimedia content.
