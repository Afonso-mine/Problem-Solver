<h1>Keyboard</h1>

<h2>1) What is the keyboard?</h2>
<p>A keyboard is an essential input device for computers and other electronic devices that allows users to input text, numbers, and commands. It consists of a set of keys arranged in a specific layout, typically QWERTY for most English-language keyboards. Each key represents a letter, number, symbol, or function that, when pressed, sends an electrical signal to the computer, which interprets it according to the current software context.</p>

<p>Keyboards can be classified into various types based on their connection method (wired or wireless), key mechanism (membrane or mechanical), and additional features (backlighting, programmable keys, ergonomic design). They are integral to tasks ranging from typing documents and emails to gaming, programming, and controlling multimedia applications.</p>

<p>Modern keyboards often include additional keys such as function keys (F1-F12), media control keys (play, pause, volume), and shortcut keys for specific software functions. Advanced keyboards may also feature customizable RGB lighting, ergonomic shapes for comfort during prolonged use, and specialized gaming features like macro keys.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the keyboard is a fundamental tool in computing, facilitating communication between the user and the computer system. Its design and functionality continue to evolve to meet the demands of various applications and user preferences.</p>
